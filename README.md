## Hi. Weclome to Tasting Notes.

Tasting Notes is a single page web application where you can add spirits to the page and add tasting notes to that spirit. In the world today there are so many spirits to enjoy but it's hard to decide which spirit would be worth trying to buying. Most places wouldn't let you try the spirit before buying it. With tasting notes you can at least get a good idea of what you might like to help you decide.

This is for my JavaScript project for Flatiron school. using front end HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Using Ruby on Rails as an API server.
